# virtual-keyboard
Virtual keyboard made with HTML5, CSS3, JS(ES6)

I made the keyboard in HTML but later down the line, i found using innerHTML to build it in JS would've been better so I could apply transitions. 
Transitions won't work with changing 'Display: none;' to 'Display: flex or whatever;. Something to keep in mind next time.
